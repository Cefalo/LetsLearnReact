This will be completely **Hands on**.

We will learn the following topics while building an [app](code/init/public/init.html):
- Basic building blocks of React
    - Components
    - Props
    - State & Lifecycle
    - Events
- JSX
- How to think in React
    - Step 1: Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy
    - Step 2: Build A Static Version in React
    - Step 3: Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State
    - Step 4: Identify Where Your State Should Live (unidirectional, predictive data flow)
    - Step 5: Add Inverse Data Flow (no 2 way data binding)
