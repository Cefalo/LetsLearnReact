# Assignment 01

We would like to build the [simpler version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cefalo/LetsLearnReact/master/_05_assignment_01/assignment_01.png) of [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/) [more specifically - popular(today) widget and search]
- Products has to be sorted based on votes and sorting should be real time.
- UI is not important. But it's better to look good. Code and CSS can be copy/paste from product hunt or bootstrap can be used.
- You can build your own `data.json` file or get the data from [here](https://api.producthunt.com/v1/docs) [you may in particular interested to [this](https://api.producthunt.com/v1/docs/posts/posts_index_get_the_tech_posts_of_today)] to build the `data.json` file.
- Search should also be real time. When no match found, it should render some useful message.

Bootstrapping:
- Run `npx create-react-app NAME_OF_THE_DIRECTORY`
- `cd NAME_OF_THE_DIRECTORY`
- `yarn start` and the project will automatically open on http://localhost:3000/
- write your code inside `src` directory. You may need to customize `public/index.html`
