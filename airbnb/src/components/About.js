                        A‌i‌r‌b‌n‌b‌,‌ ‌I‌n‌c‌.‌, is an American online marketplace and hospitality service
                        brokerage company based in San Francisco, California, United States. Members
                        can use the service to arrange or offer lodging, primarily homestays, or
                        tourism experiences. The company does not own any of the real estate listings,
                        nor does it host events; it acts as a broker, receiving commissions from each
                        booking.
